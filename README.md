> When I was creating ExpressJs project for my hobby project, I learnt the hard way to manually configure, the most wanted middleware to my ExpressJs.
> 
> More-over logging was the first thing, which helps to understand you app performance. I tried to configure different logging package & choosed one, customising was way more bigger learning. 
> 
>  This project is for Backend Service with accepts only RestAPI Communication.
>  
>  I will update this project more frequently with Test & Code Coverage, so that this project can serve the basic structure for ExpressJs Project development.
